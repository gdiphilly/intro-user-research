## Course description

Learn how to understand your website audience's needs through user research.

There are lots of steps in creating a website, but before designs are put to paper or code, you have to know your audience and who you are designing for. In this class, we'll focus on how you can research and interview potential users, and create a product that is direct and meaningful to your audience.

Before you can create a product, you must clarify who your users are and what they need. With user research, you and your team will be able discover what your target audience desires and expects from you -- so you can build a successful product for your customers.

User research will also be able to provide data for any design decisions made throughout the project, hereby helping you tackle the “If I were the user…” comment from others on your project team because we are not our users.

This class is for anyone who is interested in exploring user research techniques and diving deeper into the user experience design process. All technology specialties are welcome.
